CAEN EURICA DAQ sorter and merger

CAEN DAQ system writes out 5 files (one for each card), with the data (board, ch, energy and timestamp), but not in time order

program "sorter"
sorts each of the files by their time stamp.
usage:
        [-lb <int  >: last buffer to be read]
        [-i  <char*>: input file]
        [-o  <char*>: output file]
        [-m  <int  >: memdepth]
        [-t  <int  >: write tree]
memdepth are the number of hits kept in memroy. increase if you get error messages, 10000 is a good starting number
-t 1 writes a root tree instead of the original data format

program "merger"
merges the 5 files into one.
usage:
        [-lb <int  >: last buffer to be read]
        [-i  <char*>: input file base]
        [-o  <char*>: output file]
        [-t  <int  >: write tree]
        [-n  <int  >: number of cards]
-t 1 writes the required root tree (use -t 0 to write the original data format)
number of cards -n 5 for all 5 files (default)

script "sortandmerge.sh"
usage:
./sortandmerge <runnumber>
